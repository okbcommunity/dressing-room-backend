### Modules
- `backend` - The backend where the code lives.
- `devops` - All relevent files for deployment and running the App on a server.
- `docs` - Some documentation.
- `resources` - Files that are relevant for documentation purpose.

## ü¶æ Database

We've decided to use a `Relational Database` (PostgreSQL). Why because it's fast, scalable and we were most comfortable with it.

### Database Requirements

- Store default `traits` (including Background, Fur, Mouth, Eyes, Hat, Clothes, Eyewear) with `Bear Number` (e.g. #7227) and corresponding `public key` for each Bear (Primary key should be `public key`)
- `Public key` to fetch additional data from blockchain and keep attributes in sync (e.g. with cronjob)
- Each Bear can have **one TRAIT for each default CATEGORY**
- Attributes consist of `image urls` (different sizes and formats for different use cases ‚Üí download, frontend compositions), a `unique id` (referenced in the image link), a name (e.g. yellow) and a `category id` (Primary key should be `unique id`)
- Each **trait belongs to ONE category** and can be assigned to x Bears
- Categories consist of a `name`, a `weight` (to decide which category is added to the layer at what position) and a `unique id` (Primary key should be `uniqe id`)

#### FAQ

**Why extracted Table `Category_Weight`?** </br>
For easier sorting and adding new categories. Since if a new category is added each weight needs to be updated based on where the new category is ‚Äòranked‚Äô.

## Content Management System (CMS)

In term of management, we‚Äôll need a CMS that permits us to easily add/remove and edit Traits.
Also do we want to have the option to approve from community members submitted traits before adding them to the Dressing Room.

### Why Github as CMS?
GitHub is a hosting service for software development and version control using Git. However, temporary, it can be 'misused' as Content Management System (CMS) for the first iteration of this (POC) backend. A central part of the GitHub are `Pull Requests` and `Issues`. Both of these functionalities come into play in the CMS.

- `Pull Requests` let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. This functionality can be used for the Trait image submission process. As soon as a user submits a new Trait, a `Pull Request` is opened by the backend ([Github App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps)) and an admin can check whether the suggested changes (the newly added image and chosen Category) are appropriate. If the Trait corresponds with the Guidelines, the `Pull Request` can be merged and the changes get applied by the backend. If the Trait doesn't fit, an admin can update/correct the provided changes or close the `Pull Request`.  If the `Pull Request` is closed, the changes won't get applied.
- `Issues` let you track your work on GitHub and can be seen as tasks. Issues are like Task Items a developer has to resolve. Thus, an Issue can be used to define tasks for the backend and not the developer has to resolve the task but the backend. For example, an admin creates a new `Issue` with the Tag `add_category` and defines based on a predefined template the new Category. As soon as the Issue is submitted (e.g. via Tag `apply`) the backend reads the specified information from the Issue and implements these changes.

By using Github we avoid implementing a custom authentication system as a Github Repository has integrated authentisation and admins can be granted the required managment rights.
In the future we might design and build a custom CMS platform that purley serves the purpose of managing the Trait content.

## Image Hosting

The Trait assets need to be hosted somewhere,
where the frontend and backend can easily access them via a URL.

## üßê FAQ

### Why we've decided to use GraphQL and REST combination?

1. **Client-side data shaping + Navigating a relational Graph**
   _e.g. Frontend can decide whehter it only requires the Trait ID's of a Bear or all Trait Information already baked into the Response -> only one request instead of potential 2 as we would only return the Trait ID's via the REST API; Easier support for multipe display languages -> Frontend can decide what language the display name of a Trait should be_

2. **Auto documentation + Types for the Backend and Frontend.** Wouldn't be a problem with REST either if we could've figured out how to generate Backend Types (Typescript) based on the created `Open API` file. In Spring Boot its easy but we decided to go with NodeJs + Express for simplicity as the majority devs knows how to write Typescript and can work on frontend and backend.

3. **Using REST for POST requests** GraphQL is an awesome to dynamically query data but not really built around POST requests. For example sending formadata (for sending binary data) seems like to be easier with REST.
